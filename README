CGAL Point Location
======================================================================
This is a collection of programs built with CGAL for the purpose of
testing the point location algorithms.

* License

  See LICENSE file.

* Requirements

  - cmake
  - CGAL

* Build

  Run the following commands in the project directory
  
  1. cgal_create_cmake_script

  2. cmake .

  3. make

  To make this easy, build.sh will run these as appropriate and
  rebuild.sh will force a rebuild of the makefile (useful for adding
  new things to build).

* Programs

  - generate_random_points [n] [lower] [upper]

    Prints n random points between lower (inclusive) and upper (not
    inclusive).  Uses Boost's random.

  - random_xmonotone_points [n] [lower] [upper]

    Same as above, but the output is x-monotone increasing (useful for
    input to triangulate).

  - triangulate

    Reads an x-monotone pointset from standard input, and prints a
    triangulation of those points.

  - random_triangulation.sh [n] [lower] [upper]

    Generates a triangulation on n points between lower (inclusive)
    and upper (not inclusive).

  - point_location [segments file] [points file]

    Builds a planar subdivision using the given segments, then runs a
    query on the given points, printing the connected component
    boundary in counter-clockwise direction.
