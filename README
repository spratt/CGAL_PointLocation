CGAL Point Location
======================================================================
This is a collection of programs built with CGAL for the purpose of
testing the point location algorithms.

* Requirements

  - cmake
  - CGAL

* Build

  Run the following commands in the project directory
  
  1. cgal_create_cmake_script

  2. cmake .

  3. make

  To make this easy, build.sh will run these as appropriate and
  rebuild.sh will force a rebuild of the makefile (useful for adding
  new things to build).

* Programs

  - generate_random_points

    Prints an arbitrary number of random points.  Uses Boost's random.

  - random_xmonotone_points

    Same as above, but the output is x-monotone increasing (useful for
    input to triangulate).

  - triangulate

    Reads an x-monotone pointset from standard input, and prints a
    triangulation of those points.
